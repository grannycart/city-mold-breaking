title: Breaking the Mold of Cities 
---


[//]: # (I read somewhere that theres a substack list of best books for urban planning. This list needs to NOT be that. Instead, it needs to be about things that are *unexpectedly* about cities.)
::
To change our cities we need to be able to hold visions of what they
could be. One of the biggest challenges for cities to overcome is that
our vision for what our cities could be is almost entirely held within
a hard mold that shapes our cities with a cookie-cutter repeating
pattern. That mold is created by economic forces, real estate
shenanigans, construction costs, political realities, and the combined
desires of residents. In most cases the mold cannot be reshaped
regardless of the efforts put into making adjustments to it. Much of
the difficulty in reshaping the mold arise from the lack of *desire*
to reshape it. Even low-income people who have the most to gain by
a radically different vision for our cities often have no recourse
but to the cookie-cutter crap popped from the mold when asked what
they want their city to be like. This is one of the chief driving
force of gentrification --- poor people want the same things in their
neighborhoods that rich people want, even when those things are
exactly what undermines the distinctive character of neighborhoods.

There is no way out of this conundrum. The only thing we can do is try
to hold visions for what else our cities could be in our heads. These
visions *are* available to us --- chiefly in our fictions.

This is a list of those alternative visions of cities and what might
be significant about them to the urban planner or others with an
interest in shaping the urban environment.
