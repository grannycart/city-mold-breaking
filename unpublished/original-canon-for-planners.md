# A Canon for Planners


[//]: # (This is my original list, not for publication really.)


_This is a list of works that every Urban Planner should check out. It is unlike other lists like this in that it is not a "list of best books for planners" or anything like that. It is, instead, a list that shapes the way of seeing for a person interested in how cities work. It also is not a list of just books, because I believe sticking to only books would limit some of the greatest works about cities created in the last 50 years or so.  It tries to account for the fact that cities are influenced, created, and buffeted by complex forces including economics, sociology, anthropology, science, politics, and aesthetics. Inevitibly this list will be something about the way \emph{I} see cities. But hey, I'll check out your list when you make one too. I am going to include some of the classical canonical planning books, because some of them had a profound influence on my own life.  (Not least of which is The Power Broker.) But I'll save those for later._
(Or, something like: Not all planning books have to be dense tomes like The Power Broker. Sometimes they can be fun! This is a list of fun media that are important to urban planning.)
(Or maybe something about creating an understanding and vision of our cities through history and fictions?)
	(That is, planners are stuck in planner-world: Euro-styled, zoning and regulation. How ELSE could we imagine our cities? The first step to a more robust way of shaping cities is to understand what MAKES a city.)
	(This sems like the best approach: our best vision for our cities is through our fictions. so, ditch nonfiction from this list, maybe it goes somewhere else. But what about the flyingtrain? ok -- SOME non fiction, but te list should be abou VISIONS for cities [that COULD be fiction? kowloon walled city foe example?] the goal is to break out of the paradigm of our current vision for cities, and out of positivism version of cities. Those are best seen through fictions, [though skip blade runner] and some imaginative nonfictions)

## The Wire
Not about how great The Wire is (though it is that) but watching it with
a view as to what cities _are_. That each season covers a different
aspect of what makes cities go, and as a whole manages to cover cities
in a fairly holistic way. Include that interview with David Simon.

## Treme
(Maybe everything David Simon ever did?)
Because I am the big chief of the nation, the whole wild creation, and I won't
back down..

## Strawman
By Lou Reed is one of the great works about NYC. Maybe even more
resonant today than it was when it was written. (Quote lyrics.)
The rest of New York is really about the horror of dirty NYC. But
Strawman is about the horror to come - of uberwealthy NYC.

## Illmatic
By Nas is the single greatest rap album about life in the true urban
core of cities.

## That article about - what was it? the power of manufacturing?
The one that you and CG liked so much. Scrape this and other articles
from the bibliography.

## That famous paper about the power of the size of cities
And link to the Radiolab piece about this topic too. Maybe also
reference that Economist piece that argues that density doesn't equal
riches --- why that's right, and why that is taking a real "gdp"
money-first view of cities. (What people really want from cities is
_life_, money is just a nice common side effect of vibrant life.)

## Nature's Metropolis
Mostly the grain elevator chapters

## The Power Broker
Don't be afraid of reading it because of the size, it's a total page
turner. Find that quote from Caro "I thought if I could write
something about Moses I could say something about the nature of
power."

## SPQR
If this book does what Mary Beard's documentary about the Romans does
--- talk about the nature of the economics of Empire on the daily life
of city building, then definitely include it here.

## The City In History
See your notes for this. I'm _sure_ there's some of it that belongs on
this list.

## The Essence of Decision
Maybe? Mostly because it talks about how government works? It's just
so damn powerful, it seems like it has to be included.

## Wicked Problems
Another that is just so damn powerful it can't NOT be included.

## The Ants
By E.O. Wilson. There would be a task of pulling out of this giant
tome the pieces that are relevant to understanding cities. Maybe it
cross-refs with that "Emergence" book?

## Names on the Land
Seems like there would be great relevant stuff in here. But would have
to check my notes in this book. 

## Tool's Aenema
About the end of LA. Learn to swim. (also should be on your apocalypse mix)

## From Hell
For being about London.

## Rising Tide
For the part about deliberately blowing the levy to save NOLA.

## The Taking of Pelham 123
For obvious reasons.

## Chinatown
For obvious reasons.

## Premium Rush
For the way it keeps time by slicing up the city with the Manhattan
street numbers.

## Toynbee Tiles
Underground communication through urban infrastructure

## The Fountainhead
The _movie_ - for being insane and beautiful, and all that's wrong with architecture.

## Pragmatic trials
Read that paper on pragmatic medical trials, and see if it is a key to planning with wicked problems in mind.

## Fairytale of NY
Because it's the emotional story of immigrant life in NYC.

## First we Take Manhattan
Because it's about the end-time apocalyptic terrorism directed at the biggest finacial centers in the world.
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_We_Take_Manhattan

## Ramones
Rockaway Beach? Among a thousand other reasons that make Ramones NYC.

## On the Beach
For Melbourne with cars abandoned and everyone getting around by electric train, bicycle, and horse-drawn carriage.

## How to Build an Igloo
From the NFB; one of the great documents of architecture

## Serpico

## Pushcart Wars

## War: the world is a ghetto

## Parliament: Chocolate City

## Tread: about the Killdozer there's a calvin and hobbes where they talk about bulldozing a suburb
	* Nearly everyone, at one time or another, wants to grind their shitty little town and all it's dumb rules to dust under the slow-moving, unstoppable tread of their mighty killdozer! Planners need to know it could happen to you.
	* The scale of this thing: the rickety one-two story town vs the tall, black-armored, unstoppable killdozer.
	* Titanic battles of heavy equipment, better than Pacific Rim.
	* The police, walking slowly rifles in hand next to it, unable to do anything about it.

## Voina: Dick Captured by FSB (see youtube video)

## There's a great quote about LA mainlining freeways in Crying of Lot 49

## Bee Gees Stayin' Alive (lyrics)
* not to mention the opening scene of Saturday Night Fever

## https://harpers.org/archive/2020/11/the-sultan-of-sewers-william-s-burroughs/

## Something about the pavement ants and their huge epic battles on the sidewalks of yards and cities

## Malvina Reynolds Little Boxes

## The Flying Train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ud1aZFE0fU
* I first heard about this suspended rail in Germany in this Omnibus podcast:
	* https://www.omnibusproject.com/374
	* (Though it's also in the Pina Bausch Wim Wenders film)
* It is one of the most affecting things about urban planning I have ever heard.
* The Omnibus guys describe how the "Schwebebahn" in Wuppertal connected a series of small towns along a narrow river valley (so the towns were confined close to the river) into one long linear city of 400,000 people.
* The Omnibus guys also talk about how in Seattle they have a touristy monorail that connects the Space Needle to a mall (not useful for transit) that the residents voted multiple times to expand into a real transit system, but never happened because the town leaders and business community have long wanted Seattle to be a *serious* city, and projects like monorails (and suspended trains) are resisted because they are too 'cool', so the feeling is they must not also be practical.
* John argues against buses, claiming they are more expensive over the long run (maintenance) than rail.
* They also talk about the phenomenon of resisting stranger flights-of-fancy kinds of transit solutions only because they don't already exist. That in many cases people default to what already exists because it seems practical, though the evidence for that (particularly when it comes to transit -- which is always expensive, and almost always has to be custom-built for a particular city anyway) might be scant or questionable.
* The 1902 film shows not just how amazing it is to suspend a train over the town river, but also an crystal clear artifact (it was shot on 68mm film) of what the city looked like in 1902.
	* Most significant, to me, is the dense scale of the buildings built right up against the edge of the river. In modern videos (even though the train is still a fully functional transit system carrying 20m people a year) it looks like most of those beautiful high-density buildings are gone. 

## The Sunsphere

Electric cars, car phones, solar panels, pay-at-the-pump, and Ronald Reagan.

## WALL-E
Is there any better protrayal of what a techno-dystopian nightmare some planners would have us end up in than a inter-stellar cruise ship where everything is done by robots and the humans become soft blops of cushiony fat wheeled around in floating chairs?

## Dwarf Fortress
Forget sim city or Minecraft. There is no better video game fo capturing how cities come together thn dwarf fortress, where the individu opinion of up to hundreds of simulated dwarves come together to build an underground fortress. The one weakness in terms of modelling cities is that while df has rich residential and industrial sectors, commercial is still lacking. Though it may well be yet to come, as the lone genius developing it claims he has half-way to version 1.0 -- after 20 years of working on it.

## Warriors
* For crossing NYC
* For the Warriors bike ride
* For gangs-oriented approach to urban theory

## Gene Wolfe Shadow and Claw
* For the necropolis
